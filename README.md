# SunPharma-Stores
A database management application for a pharmaceutical store to maintain the records and get summarized reports related to sales, daily profits, expired drugs, etc.

# Abstract
Nowadays, Pharmacy management system is one of the most essential tools that are mostly used in medical store in India; it is mostly used to manage pharmacy related activities such as medical inventory, record keeping, sales management as well as managing the drug stock and information of the expired medicines. Many pharmacies in India are still operating manually; they donâ€™t have adequate software to manage their daily activities. It needs the pharmacist assistant to check the expired date of the medicine twice a week, and it can take a lot of time to find out whether certain medicine are out of stock.
In this project we tried to develop a computerised based Pharmacy management system. Our main intention is to allow this application to be used in most retailing pharmacies in India, where a small point of customization will be required to each pharmacy in the implementation period. This system is designed to overcome all challenges related to the management of medicine that were used to be handled locally and manually.
